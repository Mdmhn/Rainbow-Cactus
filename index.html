  <h2>Growing and Care Of Rainbow Cactus</h2>
  <p>When looking for a <a href="https://plantcaretoday.com/hedgehog-cactus.html">hedgehog cactus</a> with beautiful flowers, one of the first choices should be Echinocereus pectinatus (ek-in-oh-SER-ee-us pek-tin-AY-tus). The scientific name
    literally translates to “comb hedgehog”, a common name referring to the comb-like spines on its sides. </p>
  <img src="Images/Rainbow Cactus - 02.jpg" alt="Rainbow Cactus - 02">
  <h4>Some common names include:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Rainbow cactus</li>
    <li>Texas rainbow cactus</li>
    <li>Ruby rainbow</li>
    <li>Lace cactus</li>
    <li>Purple candle cactus</li>
    <li>Órgano-pequeño Peine</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What makes this member of the Cactaceae family so special is the wide range of colors the spines may exhibit. The rainbow cactus spines are arrayed in a radial pattern with between 15 and 23 spines per areole, practically obscuring the red and
    white banded stem. When the cactus flowers, it adds even more color with large, bright blooms. Native to Mexico and southwestern United States (primarily Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas), the plant is known to have one confirmed subspecies,
    Echinocereus pectinatus wenigeri, and one debated subspecies, which has been both classified as Echinocereus pectinatus ctenoides and Echinocereus dasyacanthus ctenoides. Echinocereus pectinatus var rigidissimus is the term commonly given to the
    plant when grown west of the Continental Divide and Echinocereus pseudopectinatus is another debated species to be a hybrid. Adding even more confusion, comb hedgehog is also known by the alternate scientific names Cereus pectinatus, Echinocereus
    rigidissimus, and Echinocereus rigidissimus var rubispinus. Be sure to look for all of these names when shopping for a rainbow cactus plant or seeds.</p>
  <h2>Rainbow Cactus Care</h2>

  <h3>Size & Growth</h3>
  <p>Being a hedgehog cactus, this species may have globose or cylindrical stems measuring between 8″ to 14” inches tall and 2″ to 5” inches thick. The slow-growing plant features 20 to 23 obtuse ribs and essentially no central spines. Areoles are
    oval and close but not connected, with short white hair emerging from the younger ones. Meanwhile, 16 to 30 whitish to pinkish radial spines between 7/32″ and ⅜” inches long protrude from the areolae. They often interlink, forming bands of color
    and often getting flattened into a pectinate (comb-like) appearance. The perennial rainbow cactus blooms occur throughout summer, starting as early as May and ending as late as August, depending upon the region. These give way to gooseberry-like
    fruits which are sweet and fully edible.</p>
  <h3>Echinocereus Rigidissimus Flowering and Fragrance</h3>
  <p>During the summer months, rainbow cacti produce almost comically oversized blooms. These flowers emerge from the sides of the stem as a spiny funnel shape and are diurnal. These flowers may be near-white, yellow, lavender, magenta, or an intense
    shade of pink and have cream-colored stamens. The petals are long and pointed, while the whitish-green floral tube has white hairs. While not identical, the blooms resemble those of the Echinopsis genus. After three months, these develop into a
    greenish to dark purple-brown edible fruit with white pulp.</p>

  <h3>Light & Temperature</h3>
  <p><a href="https://plantcaretoday.com/types-of-succulents.html">Succulents</a> love sunlight, and rainbow cactus is no exception. Plant it in full sunlight to ensure optimal health. Indoors, provide a window seat near-full sun throughout the day.
    Another feature of this plant is its ability to tolerate the cold for short periods of time. It may be grown from USDA hardiness zones 9a to 21b.</p>
  <h3>Watering and Feeding</h3>
  <p>It’s easy to overwater this cactus, so having a well-drained soil is an absolute must. Water once every two weeks during summer months, making sure the soil has dried out. Do not water if the soil is still moist. For winter, water only once a
    month, and avoid any watering at all when it’s humid. As with many plants, it’s possible for echinocactus pectiniferus to become iron deficient. Give the plant regular feedings of diluted <a
      href="https://plantcaretoday.com/cactus-fertilizer.html">cactus fertilizera</a> during the summer and supplement with sequestrated iron as needed.</p>

  <h3>Soil & Transplanting</h3>
  <p>Echinocereus pectinatus thrives on a <a href="https://plantcaretoday.com/best-cactus-potting-soil-succulent.html">standard cactus potting mix.</a> Some evidence suggests it may be able to grow in slightly richer soil, although this is not
    generally advised. Avoid too much lime and aim for a neutral to slightly acidic soil with high grit content when planting outdoors. Thanks to their slow growth, repotting is rare and may not need to be done for as long as two years at a time.</p>

  <h3>Grooming and Maintenance</h3>
  <p>Overall, the rainbow cactus requires very little maintenance. However, removing any plantlets and transplanting them is a good way to reduce its growth rate.</p>
  <h3>How To Propagate Comb Hedgehog</h3>
  <p>Older hedgehog cactus plants may be propagated through offsets. Remove the bud and allow a callus to form over the wound. Plant this in cactus soil and keep in a warm, slightly damp environment until it displays new growth. For plants which may
    not have begun to bud, you may also propagate using seeds. The seeds germinate within two weeks when placed in a shallow mix and kept slightly damp. Transplant to pots as needed.</p>
  <h3>Rainbow Cactus Pest or Disease Problems</h3>
  <p>Unlike many members of the cactus family, comb hedgehog doesn’t have many natural enemies. It’s vulnerable to aphids, <a href="https://plantcaretoday.com/mealybugs-on-succulents.html">succulent mealybugs</a>, and some moth larvae. A much bigger
    concern is rot, which is one of the most frequent killers of this plant when not in its natural environment.</p>

  <h3>Suggested Echinocereus pectinatus Uses</h3>
  <p>Echinocactus pectinatus is perfect for almost any ornamental use. It’s an attractive addition to rock gardens, desert-themed gardens, as a potted accent to porches, patios, and windows, or as a general indoor plant. Additionally, the fruits are
    edible, making this a great source for late summer snacking.</p>
